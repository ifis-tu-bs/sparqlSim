BitMagic Language mappings libraries.

This section provides BitMagic for languages other than C++.

libbm - C language library
jni   - Java native interface mappings

This experimental work in progress. (use at your own risk).


The build system is based on cmake. 
Currently we managed to build lib without C++ runtime dependency, which makes language bindings feasible.
